/**
 * Everything that pulls TipTap into the build lives behind this module, and
 * nothing imports it statically.
 *
 * 🚨 This file IS the performance design. TipTap and ProseMirror are ~430KB
 * minified; bundled into forum.js they are downloaded, parsed and executed by
 * every visitor on every page view, including people who never open the
 * composer and guests who cannot post at all. Splitting it behind a dynamic
 * import means a forum page costs nothing for an editor nobody opened.
