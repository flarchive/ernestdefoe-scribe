/**
 * Translates the Markdown that other extensions insert into the composer.
 *
 * 🚨 This is not a Markdown parser and must never become one. Scribe exists so
 * that typing `**bold**` stays literal — the whole point. What this handles is
 * narrower and different: text that arrives through the editor driver's
 * insert* methods from OTHER extensions, which have every reason to still speak
 * Markdown because that is the contract Flarum's driver interface has always
 * had.
 *
 * Two of these matter enough that the editor is broken without them:
 *
 *   - Quoting a post. flarum/mentions builds `> quoted text` and hands it to
 *     insertAtCursor (utils/reply.js). Without translation, highlighting a post
 *     and hitting Reply drops a literal "> " into the composer.
 *   - FoF Upload inserts `![alt](url)` after an upload finishes.
 *
 * Anything not recognised is returned as null and inserted as plain text, which
 * is the correct outcome for ordinary typing.

/*
 * 🚨 FoF Upload's OTHER format, and the reason a pasted image showed up as a
 * line of raw text.
 *
 * FoF Upload has two insert modes. In Markdown mode it hands over
 * `![alt](url)`, which IMAGE above already understands. In "image preview" mode
 * — which is the default for images and what a paste produces — it hands over
 *
 *     [upl-image-preview url=https://… uuid=… thumbnail_url=…]
 *
 * That is not Markdown and never was, so it fell through to being inserted
 * verbatim: the poster saw a bracketed line of attributes sitting in their
 * post. Reported by tennyy on Flarum 2.0.0-rc.8 with Scribe 1.1.1.
 *
 * Attributes are unordered and the set differs by version, so this reads
 * `url=` out of the tag rather than matching a fixed shape. `thumbnail_url` is
 * deliberately not preferred: the thumbnail is a downscaled copy, and quietly
 * substituting it would put a blurry image in a post whose author chose a
 * sharp one.
